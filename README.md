## Docker and Python

For this assignment, you will be combining Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file containing a URL. The QR code can be viewed with the camera on your phone, allowing a user to click on it and be directed to the target website. This program generates a QR code that links to my GitHub homepage at [https://github.com/Deneisha98](https://github.com/Deneisha98).


## Setup
1.  Goto Docker.com and Install docker - [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](here)
2.  Signup for your own Docker account 

## Submission Requirements:

1. QR Code Image: Add the QR code image that links to your own GitHub homepage below.

2. Log Image: Add an image of the logs showing successful creation of the QR code.

### Building the Image

```sh
docker build -t my-qr-app .
```
This command builds a Docker image named `my-qr-app` from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).

### Running the Container with Default Settings
```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator my-qr-app
```

Runs your QR code generator application in detached mode (`-d`) with a container named `qr-generator`.

### Setting Environment Variables for QR Code Customization

```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator \
  -e QR_DATA_URL='https://github.com/Deneisha98' \
  -e QR_CODE_DIR='qr_codes' \
  -e QR_CODE_FILENAME='exampleQR.png' \
  -e FILL_COLOR='blue' \
  -e BACK_COLOR='yellow' \
  my-qr-app


### Sharing a Volume for QR Code Output

```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator \
  -v /host/path/for/qr_codes:/app/qr_codes \
  my-qr-app
```
Mounts a host directory to the container for storing QR codes.

### Combining Volume Sharing and Environment Variables

```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator \
  -e QR_CODE_DIR='qr_codes' \
  -e FILL_COLOR='blue' \
  -e BACK_COLOR='yellow' \
  -v /host/path/for/qr_codes:/app/qr_codes \
  my-qr-app
```

A comprehensive command that configures the QR code settings and mounts volumes for QR codes.

## Setting the Arg for the URL from the Terminal

```sh
docker run -v .:/app my-qr-app --url https://github.com/Deneisha98

**Building an Image**

```sh
docker build -t image_name .
```

Builds a Docker image with the tag `image_name` from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

**Running a Container**

```sh
docker run --name container_name image_name
```
Runs a container named `container_name` from `image_name` in the foreground / attached mode

```sh
docker run -d --name container_name image_name
```
Runs a container named `container_name` from `image_name` in detached mode

**Listing Running Containers**

```sh
docker ps
```
Shows a list of all running containers.

**Stopping a Container**

```sh
docker stop container_name
```
**Removing a Container**

```sh
docker rm container_name
```
**Listing Docker Images**


```sh
docker images
```
Lists all Docker images available on your machine.

**Removing a Docker Image**


```sh
docker rmi image_name
```

Removes a Docker image.

**Viewing Logs of a Container**

```sh
docker logs container_name
```
Displays the logs from a running or stopped container.

These commands cover the essentials of building, running, and managing Docker containers and images, along with specific examples for your QR code generation application.
